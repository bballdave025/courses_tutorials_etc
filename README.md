# courses_tutorials_etc
A place to put code, notes, vids, papers, etc. that go along with my Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, etc. courses - from MOOCs, YouTube and other tutorials, academic papers, etc.

Note that the code often comes from a MOOC course or a YouTube tutorial, which will be cited in its own sub-repository. I do not claim any ownership of the code nor of the course/tutorial material. I'm using it under Fair Use. Please respect any rights that the course creators or YouTubers claim.
