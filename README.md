# courses_tutorials_etc

A place to put code, notes, vids, papers, etc. that go along with my Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, etc. courses - from MOOCs, YouTube and other tutorials, academic papers, etc.

Note that the code often comes from a MOOC course or a YouTube tutorial, which will be cited in its own sub-repository. I do not claim any ownership of the code nor of the course/tutorial material. I'm using it under Fair Use. Please respect any rights that the course creators or YouTubers claim.

## MyBinder (for Jupyter Notebooks)

For the courses including Jupyter notebooks, I have good news; you can run the Jupyter notebooks in your browser. Thanks to [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305014745/https://www.home.cern/)) - or more specifically [CERN Open Data](https://github.com/cernopendata) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305020320/https://github.com/cernopendata)) for the info. Who'd've thunk that my grad-school experience in nuclear/particle physics would come in handy?

I'll let the source explain [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220182022/https://mybinder.org/)). I first found a [page like this](https://github.com/cms-opendata-education/cms-jupyter-materials-english) that had something like the following description

> The hands-down easiest way is to use the entirely browser-based [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org), which builds a temporal, virtual workspace for you. This way you can avoid any installations or lengthy setups and get straight to work. You can even simplify that process to simple, clickable buttons like these:
>
> |Notebook|Open|
> |:--|:--|
> |Welcome to Jupyter (from CERN)!|[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/cms-opendata-education/cms-jupyter-materials-english/master?filepath=Introduction-to-jupyter/Welcome-to-Jupyter-Notebooks-intro.ipynb)|

[**Note from bballdave025**: the button above will take you to a CERN Notebook]

> MyBinder works 99% of the time without problems, but it is still in beta and can sometimes be under active development. One alternative is to use Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but that does require a google account log-in.
